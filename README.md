# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank. It encompasses the entire data science workflow, from data preprocessing to model deployment, providing a comprehensive solution for identifying potential customer churn.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning model development (Random Forest and XGBoost)
- Model evaluation and selection
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation
- Predictive functionality
- Web-based deployment using Streamlit

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing and Model Training**: Jupyter notebook containing all data preparation steps and initial model training.

2. **OOP Implementation**: Conversion of the best performing model into an object-oriented format.

3. **Prediction Module**: Standalone script for making predictions using the trained model.

4. **Web Deployment**: Streamlit application for easy model interaction and testing.

5. **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the project workflow and methodologies.
